# Lab3SD_webAPI

This ASP.NET Web API project serves as a backend for a tableware store application. The project leverages Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) using ADO.NET and Entity Framework (EF) to interact with the underlying TablewareStore database. The database consists of tables related to customers, products, orders, reviews, payments, and more.

Features
- ORM Integration:
The project incorporates both ADO.NET and Entity Framework for seamless interaction with the database. ADO.NET provides a low-level, high-performance data access layer, while EF offers a higher-level, object-oriented abstraction.

- Database Schema:
The TablewareStore database includes tables such as customers, products, orders, reviews_ratings, payment_transactions, and others, capturing essential aspects of the tableware store's operations.

- API Endpoints:
The Web API exposes various endpoints to perform CRUD operations on entities like customers, products, orders, and reviews. These endpoints follow RESTful principles, providing a standardized and intuitive interface for interacting with the application.
